# Data-Analysis-Project-Sales-Trends-and-Consumer-Insights

## Introduction
This project involves analyzing a sales dataset from Kaggle, containing information about an international company's sales over three years. The aim of this analysis is to gain insights into the sales trends over time, identify the most successful months, quarters, and years, and understand the distribution of deal sizes.

## Data Wrangling
The initial step involved cleaning the dataset, which included handling encoding issues, dropping unnecessary columns ('TERRITORY' and 'ADDRESSLINE2'), and converting the 'ORDERDATE' column to datetime format. Missing values in the 'POSTALCODE' column were replaced with '0' for consistency.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
### Overall Sales Trend
The analysis revealed that sales increased from 2003 to 2004 and then decreased in 2005. However, the reason for the decrease in sales in 2005 was not determined due to limitations in the dataset.

### Best Selling Periods
- The fourth quarter and November month had the highest sales.
- The United States was found to be the main driver of increased sales in November, but limitations in the dataset hindered further analysis of the contributing factors.

### Deal Size Analysis
- Three deal sizes ('Small', 'Medium', 'Large') were analyzed, with 'Medium' deals being the most popular in terms of quantity ordered and sales.

### Other Insights
- The transportation network was analyzed, with land transport being the most commonly used method.
- The top consuming countries were identified as USA, Spain, France, Australia, and the UK.

## Conclusions
The analysis provided valuable insights into sales trends, best-selling periods, and deal size preferences. Recommendations for the company include focusing on strengthening relationships in the US market and paying attention to the development of the land transport network.

## Limitations
- Lack of detailed product information limited the analysis of product-specific trends.
- Incomplete or inaccurate data in the 'STATE' column hindered geographical analysis.

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are suggested:
1. Focus on expanding and improving the land transport network.
2. Implement targeted marketing strategies and special offers in the US market.
